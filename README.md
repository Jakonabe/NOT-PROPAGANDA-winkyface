**Chapter 1: The man who shook his world**

He was in a hurry, so he didn’t look where he was going, obviously, he ran into someone. They tumbled to the floor a tangle of contrasting limbs.

“What are you doing\!” He exclaimed angrily, “I’m the president of the United States\!”

“Hah” his unknown nuisance chuckled softly and kindly, “I remember when I ran the country”

Trump looked up in surprise, and in that moment he realised that he had run into Barack Obama, the godly man himself. He was silent, he had never seen him in person, he had ridiculed him publicly many times before. What poetic irony then, that he was in love with him.

He was instantly a nervous mess, his legs were shaky and he could barely form sentences. In the end, his love walked away after checking that he was alright. For the rest of the day, Trump’s only thoughts resided on Obama, when he fell asleep, his last waking thought was of his lover, his dreams that night were filled with godly images of his beloved.

The next morning, he woke up in a cold sweat, but he had had an idea, he would ask out his crush for a coffee date\! He frantically dialed his number and nervously asked him out. 

“Why, that sounds like fun, I’ll meet you tomorrow” said Obama in his silky smooth voice over the phone. 

Trump was ecstatic, he couldn’t believe his luck\! He will get his chance tomorrow\! He would have to pace himself to not scare him off, his heart was aching, but he knew Obama’s love would be worth the wait.

**Chapter 2: The Date He Would Never Forget**

Obama's hands were shaking, he wasn’t usually like this, he was calm and collected, but ever since he had run into the president, he was a nervous wreck. Today was the day that he would meet him again, he was more nervous than he had ever been.

He entered the coffee shop, it was a quaint little place, there weren’t too many people and the baristas seemed nice. He quickly scanned his eyes across the room, his voluptuously dark brown eyes dilated as he saw his love sitting nervously in the corner of the shop. 

He hastily walked over to Trump and sat down quickly, he greeted him softly and blushed deeply. 

“H-how are you, Mr President?” he said as he tried to maintain his composure.

“I-I’m good, thank you for leaving such a beautiful country for me to look over,” Trump said softly and blushed even deeper than Obama had.

When the waiter came over, they ordered one large coffee each, both got a mocha with extra sugar. They blushed as they realised they had ordered the exact same coffee. 

After a few minutes of nervous small talk, their coffees arrived. The waiter put down a cup squarely in the middle of the table, closer to not one more than the other. The locked eyes and blushed. They hesitantly reached out towards the same hot, steamy cup of coffee. Their hands brushed against each other, Trump's hand recoiled slightly, but he slowly put his hand back onto Obama’s and they raised their heads and locked eyes again.

They sat there, frozen in time for what seemed like hours, then slowly, they raised their hands and interlocked their fingers.

“I” Obama started as his face went bright red.

“Love” Trump said, adding onto his sentence.

“You” they both said together, they looked like they were going to explode from nervousness.

They chuckled and sighed with relief, they could never have imagined how this date would go, they could never have imagined how *well* the date would go. 

**Chapter 3: The Sleepover**

Trump was ecstatic and he could tell that Obama was too, as soon as they confessed their love to each other they left the coffee shop and went back to the white house. They made their way back there with eachothers hands in theirs, skipping down the streets of Washington.

Trump let Obama into his house and made him a guest, although Obama seemed to be the one who was in control of the situation. They talked and they chatted for hours and hours, before they could barely keep awake.

Trump yawned and Obama secretly swooned at his luscious and soft double chins. 

“Well” obama said with dreamy eyes and a silky voice, “I guess we might head off to bed then”

Trump’s heart quickened, he could barely believe this was happening, “y-yes, that would be good” He stuttered shyly.

They slowly staggered off to Obama’s old room and held hands down the hallway. When they got to the bedroom Trump turned on his dimmed pink lights.

Trump turned to Obama with a long practised smirk and asked him, “ya like jazz?” as he dropped the record needle onto his smooth jazz vinyl.

Trump realised that he had forgotten to pack up before Obama came to his house. He realised that he had left his shrine of Obama. Trump was flustered, he had Obama’s old underwear on display carefully placed onto his Obama body pillow, as if Obama were still wearing them.

 “Well what do we have here”, Obama said with a playful smirk.

Obama’s eyes drifted off of his dirty underwear and onto Trump's face, then, his gaze started to go down Trump's body. Obama slowly walked over to Trump and gently lay his hands onto Trump’s sequined shirt, and slowly unbuttoned it. 

“O-obama wait”,Trump said, it was all happening so fast, his face went a bright red. This was the moment he’d been waiting for and the last thing he wanted was to mess it up.

Obama slowly recoiled his hands. “There’s something I want you to use”, Trump said, stuttering while he pointed under his bed, Obama looked over at Trump and flashed a look of happy understanding. Then he signalled for Trump to bend down and get it.

Trump slowly got down on his wrinkly knees to fetch the box of toys from under his bed

“Y'know, I used to use these with melania, before she died that was, but now it ju-” Trump stopped midway through his sentence and he felt his pants getting slowly pulled down. “Wh-what are you doing?” he nervously asked his lover.

Obama caressed his face with his strong and calloused hands, “well” he chuckled, “I figured I would come prepared.”

All of a sudden Trump felt Obama’s strong hands grasp his supple cheeks. He was scared, but hungry for Obama’s long schlong. He gasped, he felt a large, plastic intrusion enter his old but largely unused butt-hole.

Obama reached down and put his mouth close to Trumps left ear, “I’m gonna fuck you like you fucked the economy.”

Trump bit his lip, “oh yeah, I know you aren’t mexican so I'll let you come inside”

**Chapter 4: The Morning After**

Trump slowly staggered out of the bedroom, he could barely walk for obvious reasons. He made his way to the kitchen and saw Obama pouring himself a glass of orange juice.

Obama smiled with warmth when he saw him, “did you enjoy last night?” he asked with a smirk. 

“Very much.” Trump said, and sat down with a painful wince.

Obama sat down next to him and handed him his orange juice. He gently stroked Trump's chin and smiled. They were contently enjoying each other's company when Trump got a call on his iPhone 11 Pro Max. His content smile turned into an annoyed frown.

“Putin is asking for me,” he said dejectedly.

Obama was concerned, “Oh, will you be okay? I know you two used to date, I can go with you if you want” he offered his lover.

“No no”, Trump said as he put on a brave face, “I'm a big boy, I'll manage.”

**Chapter 5: The Meeting**

Trump walked through the doors, his hands were shaking and he felt light headed. He was about to see Putin for the first time since they broke up. He walked into the reception room and was greeted by a young woman who was holding two large coconuts.

He walked up to the desk and before he realised what he was doing he reached out and grabbed one of the lady’s coconuts.

“Oh\!” Trump exclaimed embarrassedly, “I'm so sorry\! Old habits die hard I guess.”

The receptionist laughed nervously, she would’ve been furious were it anyone else, but she had fallen deeply in love with her aggressor, and only managed a shy smile. She directed him to the elevator and sighed as her only chance at love walked out of sight.

The elevator doors opened and Trump was greeted by a picture of Putin, shirtless and sweaty, wrestling a bear. His heart skipped a beat as he saw the gently toned muscles of his ex-lover. He walked down the hall and sat down in the chair opposite to Putin. 

Putin was wearing a grey singlet and tight shorts. Trump knew what he was doing, he was trying to distract him, make him agree to a bad deal. Trump signed. It was working. Trump could barely hear what Putin was saying, he was transfixed by Putin’s arms, they were massive, but firm and shapely, and even when he wasn’t flexing he had three defined muscle contours on each of his forearms and veins that snaked up them like a million serpents, his triceps were somehow bigger than his biceps and Trump could see his traps even when he was facing forward. When putin gestured, his lats bulged, when he stood, his thighs bulged so much he could see the individual muscle fibres, when he balled his fists, his pecs tensed so much that his nipples pointed upwards. Trump was utterly and hopelessly infatuated with him.

Putin reached out and shook his hand with Trump's, wrapping his left hand around his and Trump's right hands. Trump felt a rush of blood leave his upper body as his hand was grasped by Putin’s. His hands were both calloused from hard work, but also soft and moisturised.

Trump was almost in a trance, numbly agreeing to everything his ex-lover said until the meeting concluded and he got up and left. His mind was still in a daze when he walked out of the building and accidentally grabbed the receptionist’s coconuts again. He walked down the street and all the way back home to the white house, where Obama was waiting for him. Naked.

Trump was exhausted from the day's events, but he felt a rush of energy when he saw his lover. He quickly took off his red suit jacket and crop top with ‘daddy’s little slut’ printed on it and jumped onto the bed. He knew he was going to have a good night.

**Chapter 6: An Exciting Idea**

Obama woke up with Trump snuggled in his arms. He felt his heart bulge, along with another part of his body, and got down to continue last night's business.

After their titillating morning, they relaxed in the sun, when an idea as great as the glory of the Roman Empire struck Obama. He immediately bolted upright with a wide grin. 

“Hey lover, so you know how the economy is going down the drain because of you” Obama opened his preposition.

Instead of getting defensive, Trump smiled his signature smile, like a frog that had just caught a fly. “Well, yes” he replied warmly.

“I think I have a way to make back all the trillions you lost” Obama continued, piquing Trump's interest. He smiled, “you stream.”

Trump had seen people stream, so he knew what he was just asked. To be honest, he couldn’t be happier. It was a perfect idea, he didn't even have to show his face, and he could really use the money.

Obama was the brains behind the operation, after they decided on doing it he went to the store and picked up the needed equipment. They did a test run and then they were ready to go.

**Chapter 7: A Business Success**

Before they went live, they realised that they needed to build an audience, so Trump tweeted out a cryptic note, where all that was said was the time they would go live and said that he was helping a friend.

They anxiously waited until it was time to go live, they started sweating and even shaking, they knew that it was going to be a success, after all, it had to be.

A timer on Obama’s Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 3 went off and they knew it was time. They booted up the camera and they went live.

For a few minutes there were no more than three viewers on the stream, but then all of a sudden the viewers skyrocketed into the thousands\! His stream was raided by Mia Malkova herself\! Trump couldn’t believe it, it was a major success\! All of a sudden he was getting donations by the truckload\! He could barely keep up with all the names\! In the end, he ended up showing his feet for a few hundred dollars, although the viewer who asked was Australian for some reason.

When the stream ended they counted their money and saw that they had almost made a thousand dollars. They could barely believe their luck. That night they went to bed content and moist.

The next day they decided to stream again, this time on a more adult site. Again Trump tweeted out the time, but added the link as well this time. Before they went live Obama decided to  upgrade the camera and lighting with some of the money they got from yesterday's stream, along with some new toys, to get even more donations. Obama even got a foot mask to please that mystery viewer.

They went live and got even more viewers than yesterday\! It was amazing\! In the first ten minutes they had amassed more than one hundred dollars\! They were ecstatic in their success. They went all out in a make-out session without even realising to turn the camera off\! 

They only remembered about the stream when Obama was wearing nothing but his socks. Trump ripped his face off of his lover and turned it to his computer monitor. His face was red out of embarrassment and he felt like he was going to die, but when he looked at the screen he saw that they had made 51 billion dollars\!

They frantically looked at the donation history, all the while still scantily clad. They scrolled down until they saw that australian man from last time, it was him who had donated all of the money and who was now a tier three sub of theirs, how delightful.

The donation came in addition to a short but heart-emoji ridden comment that said, “\<3 love you guys\<3\<3\<3, don’t tell \<3 Shorty but\<3 this is actually \<3\<3 the budget for the NBN \<3\<3\<3.”

**Chapter 8: Decorating the White Home.**

After their streaming success, they had realised that they no longer had a need to continue it anymore, so, to the sadness of one australian man, they stopped.

They had been going strong for two weeks now and had decided that the White House was in desperate need of some new furniture, so one afternoon they decided to go to Ikea.

They entered the shopping mall with childish gidd and half skipped into the large entrance of Ikea. Obama, being the responsible one, took a pencil and paper to write down the furniture that piqued their fancy.

The first section that they came across was the living room section, full to the brim with lovely, homey rooms with nice and smooth leather couches, beautiful decor, luxurious curtains and big flatscreen T.V.s. Where they pretended to be an old married couple watching an opera.

Once they had had their fun they made their way over to the bathroom section and jokingly fangirled over a toilet made entirely of gold. They took selfies with it and on it, they made up fake scenes involving the toilet, and in the end decided to put it down onto the list.

Next they moved onto the bedroom section, they were like schoolboys, making crude jokes about what they would do in the bedroom with each other. They lay down on one of the beds and gazed deeply into each other's eyes, seeing not only love but a deep lust and passion for one another. They lay there and shut out the world, for in that precious moment, all that mattered, all that existed was each other.

At last they got up and continued until they got to their plushie section. Where Obama grabbed a small plush toy from one of the baskets and playfully threw it at Trump who was so startled by it he literally jumped out of his pants.

Trump’s belt had come undone when his feet had left the ground and now lay in a tangle of fabric on the floor. Trump’s face turned as red as lobster as his old, Parkinson's riddled hands fumbled to pull up his pants. The sequins glued onto his pastel pink underwear shimmered under the bright overhead lights. People browsing around the couple snickered as they read ‘Obama’s Toy’ on the backside of the president’s undergarments.

Obama hoisted up his distressed lover’s pants and they quickly scampered away deeper into the store. Trump’s mind was racing, he felt severely embarrassed, but was confused when he felt a second emotion. It was hard to consciously observe, but he knew it was there. It lay under the strong twang of embarrassment, like a continuous artery below a pulsing vein, ever present and slowly flowing, he was unsure why, but Trump knew he felt deep arousal.

**Chapter 9: A Challenging Surprize**

The next day, Trump woke up. He woke up and felt lightheaded and uneasy. He told his lover about it and was reassured not to worry about it. Trump was still worried.

The couple enjoyed a nice relaxing breakfast prepared by Obama. Trump smiled and ate his sausages and milk. While they were eating, Obama noticed a bit of milk on Trump’s face, and licked it off for him.

After they finished eating, Trump went out for a walk. He strolled down the cracked pavement, almost tripping as his mind wandered. He had grown up in this town, he knew every street and alley like the back of his old, wrinkled hand. Before he had even realised what he was doing, he had arrived at the pharmacy.

His subconscious knew what he wanted, so Trump had to go inside. Trump would have refused but he had read all of Sigmund Freud’s works and was one of his first followers, so he knew how important the id was so his ego decided to mediate it, and entered the store.

He nervously wandered around the store, weakly pretending to care about the skincare products on the shelf and slowly mustered up the courage to speak to the store clerk.

“H-hello, do you sell pregnancy tests?” he asked meekly. 

The store clerk nodded and rang one up for Trump, who promptly paid and left. When he got back home he used the test and had his fears confirmed.

He sat down with Obama and looked him in the eye, “I have something to tell you” he said with fake confidence, “I-I’m pregnant.”

Obama went quiet, for what seemed like an eternity he said nothing. After what was only fifteen seconds he spoke, his mouth curved up into a beaming grin, “that’s wonderful\!” he exclaimed as he enveloped Trump in his arms.

Not a minute had passed since Trump had broken the news and Obama was racing to go shopping. He couldn’t wait to buy a cozy cot and snug onesies for their baby to wear. They went to every baby store they could think of and bought well over ten thousand dollars worth of things. It was a lot but they were willing to splurge, after all, they were the \#powercouple2020, as trump liked to say.

**Chapter 10: A Stroll in the Park**

A few days later, Trump and Obama were taking a stroll through the city on a beautiful spring day. The flowers they passed were in full bloom and the park they walked through was buzzing with life. Everywhere they turned was filled with joy and happiness, kids were throwing frisbees and long married couples were enjoying picnics.

At the edge of the park was forest, the forest was calm and inviting, so they decided to veer off the track for some alone time. They left the carefully maintained paths of the park and stepped into the slippery moss of the forest. 

Obama was completely silent, just taking in all the surrounding life. He marvelled at the quiet but carrying coos of the birds, the vibrant coluors of the caterpillars taking refuge upon the logs, the beautiful flight of a monarch butterfly looking for a feast. He could not remember a time he had felt such an overwhelming sense of being at peace. He turned to his lover and hugged him tight, he thanked him for bringing him to such an otherworldly place.

After five minutes of walking they could no longer hear humanity. After ten minutes the thought that anybody else even existed seemed funnily absurd, like flying cars or free healthcare.

They were walking for what could have been hours or days, nobody was keeping track. Through the thinning jungle they marched peacefully, until the underbrush broke to reveal a cliff overlooking the sunset. 

**Chapter 11: A Cliff of Surreality**

It was breathtaking. The amazing view overlooking the bustling city, the soft sunset coating it in a golden, almost heavenly light, the wonderful company that the other experienced it with.

It was perfect. For many minutes all that was uttered was sighs of astonishment and soft ‘woahs’. Obama wasn’t afraid of heights, so he walked closer to the cliff’s edge to get a better view.

“Wait\!” hastily exclaimed Trump, “it’s dangerous\!”

Obama smiled that same warm smile that had made him fall in love with him, and continued. He stopped not 10 centimeters from the edge and looked up, up at the darkening sky and let go all the tension from his chest. He sighed happily, it felt good.

He looked back down and heard a sudden crack, as the rock underneath his feet broke off and fell.

He looked up and time slowed down, his mouth was gaping open like a fish and his eyes were wide. His fall looked angelic, like Lucifer descending from the Heavens. His arms flailed as he grasped out for anything he could hold on to, his legs kicked and thrashed, as if fighting an invisible enemy.

Trump’s heart stopped, and all he heard was a heavy thump. He raced down the cliff as fast as he could, all the while cursing his old age and fragile body. When he finally reached the bottom he feared it would be too late.

He weakly shambled over to Obama and cupped his head in his hands, his eyes fluttered and life still remained in his body. Obama motioned downwards at his legs as blood started to seep through the khaki fabric of his right pant leg. Trump saw the outline of his thigh, just above the knee his leg veered sharply off to the left. 

He frantically bunched up the pant leg, but stopped when his love sharply inhaled in intense pain. He slowly tugged up the pant leg until the break was exposed. Bile quickly rose up the back of his throat when he saw Obama's horribly broken femur. The bone had snapped into two parts when he had fallen, below it was a bloody path in his lower leg where the bone had torn apart the muscle in its journey to the outside of his now mangled thigh. Obama uttered a sharp, weak gasp as fresh air flooded into the exposed muscle of his leg. The ripped tendons and muscles of his leg pulsed and spasmed like a heart that didn’t yet know that it was without a body. 

The exposed wound seeped blood uncontrollably. Arteries and veins alike pulsed and spat blood out onto the clay-like rock floor, the bright red blood quickly turned brown as it mixed with the dirt of the ground. Trump hastily took off his jacket to use as a bandage. His hands grasped the leg when for the first time he realised that the leg was no longer in one piece. He violently spewed his lunch onto the hard rock when the realisation occurred to him. He recovered weakly and tried to cover the wound with his jacket. Obama no longer winced, all he said now was two depressing words.

“I’m cold” he spoke softly. It wasn’t a complaint, but a plea.

Trump shakingly wrapped the jacket fully over the leg and tied it in a loose knot. It wouldn’t hold well but it was all his frantic mind could manage. He gently dabbed the broken area to soak up the blood.

“I’m cold” Obama moaned weakly.

Trump knew little about first aid, but the jacket was stemming the flow of blood. For a second unlikely hope flashed into his mind, but deep down he knew that Obama was too old and had already lost too much blood to make it through the night. He hugged and consoled him and told him everything would be alright. His heart contracted with pain each time he told Obama he would be alright because he knew what he was saying wasn’t true.

“I’m cold.” was all Obama would say.

They lay there weakly in each other's embrace for what could have been years. Trump felt absolutely powerless, for a moment he felt like a little boy again, too young to shut anything out, only being able to stand there as the fierce waves of sorrow and grief pounded his young mind.

Obama’s already half-glazed eyes stared up into Trump’s, he opened his mouth and for a few seconds all that left it was a strained rasp. His eyes morphed into ones filled with fear and pain, like the ones of a deer trapped in a bear trap, unaware of how it got into it’s situation but aware of the searing pain that it now felt.

“I’m cold.” Obama spoke quietly, staring far away into the starry night sky.

Trump grasped Obama as tightly as he was able to without hurting him, trying to transfer his warmth to his lover. He touched Obama’s face, when he took his hand away it was covered in sweat. Trump looked at his lover, he was burning up but didn’t have the sense to know it. 

“I’m cold.” Obama repeated, weaker than before. Those simple words had turned into a terrible mantra that Trump knew would only stop once his love was dead.

Trump felt like a mother comforting her hurt child, unable to make their pain stop but trying her best regardless. He held onto Obama as tight as he could now, hoping that maybe if he held tight enough death wouldn’t be able to take his love away from him. He shut his eyes tight and felt Obama weakly return the embrace.

“I’m cold.” He spoke softly.

Trump held his love tightly in his arms for what could have been hours, only stopping when he felt Obama's arms fall to the side and his body go slack.

He shed a tear and slowly pulled his face away from his love’s. He looked deep into Obama’s glazed over eyes. For the first time in his life he understood a great truth. He finally understood what the pastors preached about, what the vikings killed for, what the aztecs sacrificed for. All their actions stemmed from the same truth, the truth that man was nothing but a soul. Nothing but a mind.

The body was nothing but a docile creature for the mind to control, he realised. A shell that the mind lived in and used.

When the mind wanted to speak, the mouth would open. When the mind wanted to run, the legs would move. When the mind wanted to fire the gun, the fingers would pull the trigger. Man was mind, and once the mind was gone, all that was left was the shell.

Again he stared down at his love. This time he looked through a lens of cold dissociation. He studied his lover and no longer did he see the intelligence and kindness that he fell in love with, but the sack of meat and bones that Obama’s mind once piloted. The slack body looked and smelled and felt like Obama, but it was no longer love. Without the mind, the body was empty. Empty and useless.

Trump stared at the body he held in his arms. Too far deep in shock to comprehend the loss that had just occurred. He sat there motionless, staring at the body until he started shivering from the cold. 

At last a single tear fell from his eye, landing on his dead lover. Grief had finally caught up to him. 

He started sobbing, louder and louder until the echoes of his cries could be heard all around. He jerked his head up to heaven and screamed. He cursed God for everything He had done. At last the valley in which he was in went silent once more. The broken man closed his tear filled eyes and wished never to have to open them again.
